# iOSCalculator
iOSCalculator is a project focusing on mastering skills utilizing the Swift coding language and XCode. 
Includes an improved color scheme and enhanced functionality. Uses alignment and size constraints in 
order to ensure that no cliiping occurs across different device layouts. Will continue to update with 
increased functionality including things like exponents, etc.
